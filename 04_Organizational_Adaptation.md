#4. Organizational Adaptation

We are living and working in a time of digital transformation. Emerging platforms and technologies impact nearly all aspects of our day-to-day lives, and promise new levels of speed and efficiency. If the SJMA is to thrive in the digital age, it is important that all staff become comfortable and proficient with the new tools and workflows emerging technologies afford.

The world is evolving around us, so why should a museum stand in opposition to this transformation? SJMA embraces this reality and works toward molding the organization into a museum that adapts quickly with technology and marches confidently into the digital future.

###4.1 Empowering a digital mindset

The museum works to empower staff to think critically and creatively about technology. With digital initiatives at the front of our minds, we can be creative and proactive with concepts and projects. We bring technology into project conversations early and create integrated experiences that marry digital and analog elements in compelling ways.

###4.2 Developing internal skill-sets

The Manager of Digital Strategy along with other key members of the digital team serve as an internal resource for staff and organize learning opportunities intended to develop internal skill-sets with digital tools. The more comfortable staff becomes and the more successes we have with our digital toolbox, the more willing we are to continue our collective growth and knowledge base.

###4.3 New organizational workflows

Digital activities should not be siloed into media or marketing departments, but instead woven into the fabric of the museum. Diffusing digital knowledge and skills throughout the organization makes room for the digital roles in media and marketing to focus on innovation at the leading edge of the digital sphere and increases capacity for the organization overall.

Evaluating and streamlining existing organizational workflows to optimize productivity and promote the use of existing technological resources will increase the museum's capacity to pursue new, exciting digital projects with more ease and success.

###4.4 Strategy In Action

The following are projects initiated or deployed between 2015 and 2017 that exemplify the Organizational Transformation strategy outlined above:
