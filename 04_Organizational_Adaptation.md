# 4. Organizational Adaptation

 If SJMA is to thrive in the digital age, it is important that all staff become comfortable and proficient with the new tools and workflows emerging technologies afford. Emerging technologies impacts nearly all aspects of our day-to-day lives, and promise new levels of speed and efficiency.The world is evolving around us and SJMA embraces this reality and works toward molding the organization into a museum that adapts quickly with technology and marches confidently into the digital future.

### 4.1 Empowering a digital mindset

The museum works to empower staff to think critically and creatively about technology. With digital initiatives at the front of our minds, we can be creative and proactive with concepts and projects. When we bring technology into project conversations early and create integrated experiences that marry digital and analog elements in compelling ways.

### 4.2 Developing internal skill-sets

The Manager of Digital Strategy (MDS) along with other key members of the digital team serve as an internal resource for staff and organize learning opportunities intended to develop internal skill-sets with digital tools. The MDS will also maintain an awareness of current workflows and processes that may need assessment and will also rely on staff to make them aware of stress points. The MDS will seek the most appropriate solutions to these challenges, whether digital or analog. The more comfortable staff become and the more success we have with our digital toolbox, the more willing we are to continue our collective growth and build our knowledge base.

### 4.3 New Organizational Workflows

Digital activities ought to be the responsibility of all departments rather than being siloed into only one area. Encouraging professional development of digital skills throughout SJMA allows digital roles in all departments to focus on innovation, overcome daily IT struggles, and increases capacity of the museum overall. In addition, evaluating and streamlining existing organizational workflows to optimize productivity and promote the use of existing technological resources will increase the museum's capacity to pursue new, exciting digital projects with more ease and success.

### 4.4 Technical Resources

While technology is transforming how museums engage with visitors, it also has the capacity to transform the way museums are run and to improve the productivity of our staff. Access to the right tools for the work we are doing directly impacts our bottom line and our ability to deliver experiences to the public.
