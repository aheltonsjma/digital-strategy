# 3. Narratives and Access

As museums and cultural heritage institutions, we are the keepers, creators and stewards of artwork and their narratives. SJMA is a leading showcase in the Bay Area for modern and contemporary art. The Museum has earned a reputation for its fresh, distinctive exhibitions, which are conceived to engage Museum visitors of various ages and cultural backgrounds.  Through its exhibitions and programs, SJMA addresses major trends in international contemporary art, architecture, and design, with an ongoing commitment to also place the work of California artists in national and international context.

Digital technologies provide new ways of sharing stories and inviting participation through transparent open access. In the coming years we will continue to work to increase operational transparency and access to the museum's collection and its compelling narratives.

###3.1 Transparency

In the digital age, availability of all known information supersedes the availability of total or complete information. SJMA Museum embraces this notion and works to make all known information about the museum and its collection available in standard and useable formats.

Tactics employed for increasing institutional transparency may include the implementation of digital dashboards, a communication strategy highlighting behind-the-scenes activity, or an open call for digital users to provide feedback and information about objects in the museum's collection.

###3.2 Access

Museums often create their own barriers that prevent users from accessing objects, scholarship and narratives. These barriers to access touch every point along the user/visitor experience journey, from purchasing tickets to viewing collection objects online to participating in a dialogue with museum staff. We must put digital technologies to work in addressing where barriers to access exist and eliminate those barriers wherever possible.

SJMA designs the digital experience around accessibility with the goal of providing experiences that are available for anyone who desires them, regardless of background or ability.

###3.3 Open Frameworks

SJMA embraces an open source ethos and commits to deploying initiatives on open frameworks and according to standard protocols. This allows the museum to operate rapidly and participate in the broader community dialogue that surrounds open source frameworks.
