# 1. Introduction

What does it mean to be a museum in the digital age? How can digital experiences and emerging technology help SJMA successfully meet its mission? Where do we begin our path toward becoming truly optimized for the evolving digital landscape, and why should we begin at all?

Many museums are confronting questions like these with their first formal digital strategy. This document is intended to be a roadmap as the museum works to infuse digital activities into its fabric. From in-gallery interactive projects to the digital literacy of our staff, a structured strategy helps the museum stay focused on the priorities and goals we have identified herein, and it serves as a repository for tracking our progress along the way.

###A Real-Time Document

SJMA's digital strategy for 2020-2021 is a real-time document. This means it is living and evolving as we deploy tactics to meet the strategies contained herein. Each strategic thrust includes a *Strategy in Action* section, where we will make updates, additions and notes about ongoing activities.

By structuring our digital strategy as a living document, we have the freedom to respond quickly to external conditions, such as rapid shifts in technology and real-time digital metrics reporting. A transparent document such as this also keeps the museum publicly accountable for progress and momentum.

##1.1 Vision Statement

The San José Museum of Art reflects the diverse cultures and innovative spirit of Silicon Valley. Through its exhibitions, programs, scholarship, and collections, SJMA connects the present and past, the art of the West Coast and the world. The Museum fosters awareness of artists' broad contributions to society and engages audiences with the art of our time and the vitality of the creative process.

In order to realize this vision, the museum has identified the following strategic goals:

1. Explore and implement ideas and technology at the intersection of the art and innovation communities
2. Nurture relationships with community partners and integrate them into the process of developing digital experiences at the museum
3. Broaden the impact of SJMA's digital presence on-site, off-site, and in all aspects of engagement with visitors, donors, and artists
4. Engage the public in exploring creative and experimental technological processes
5. Utilize technology to increase accessibility of museum programs for diverse abilities

Each department in the museum is approaching its role and work with this vision statement and set of strategic goals in mind.

###A Borderless Museum

In addition to the vision outlined above, it is also important to bring attention to SJMA's overarching goal of becoming a borderless museum, and to becoming essential to creative life throughout the diverse communities of San José and Silicon Valley.

Digital and emerging technologies are fundamental elements that help SJMA realize these goals and acknowledge the increasingly important role of digital activities within the museum space. The nexus of art and technology is the cornerstone which makes the experiences we offer our visitors relevant and engaging in an evolving digital landscape and invites them to engage with contemporary ideas about technology and culture with playful curiosity.

##1.2 Strategic Thrusts

SJMA has identified several areas of intense focus for digital and emerging technology in the coming years. These areas of focus align with the museum's broader strategic goals and are designed to compliment them.

Strategic thrusts for 2020-2021 include:

* Experiences and Engagement
