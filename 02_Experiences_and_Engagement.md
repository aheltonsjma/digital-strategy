# 2. Experiences and Engagement

SJMA's most fundamental interest is in engaging visitors around the objects and scholarship that takes place here. We offer experiences that are intellectually fulfilling, emotionally stimulating, and leave visitors craving more. Alongside the compelling experiences offered by SJMA is an ethos of open engagement around museum collections, exhibitions and programming. Emerging technologies allow the museum to participate in meaningful ways with visitors, whether they are on-site or online.

### 2.1 On-site

People have many choices when considering where and how to spend their leisure time and money. Here in Silicon Valley, someone could attend a ball game, enjoy a tasty meal, go to a concert, visit a museum or one of many cultural institutions within the city. All of these options offer unique experiences. The experience at SJMA must not only be top-tier in Silicon Valley, but also must be world class. The museum's gallery experience must be active, participatory, surprising and delightful.

With respect to digital technologies, experiences should be seamless and available to visitors who want them but unobtrusive when they don't. They should align with visitor behaviors and compliment the museum experience in a meaningful way. We do not deploy technology projects for technology's sake or as an afterthought.

Instead, the digital components to the on-site gallery experience are a part of the discussion from a project's inception, through its installation, and throughout its duration. Having digital leadership involved from the outset is instrumental in creating seamless, integrated experiences.

### 2.2 Online

Much like physical visitors have options when deciding where to spend their time, attention and money, online visitors also have choices. The Internet offers infinite choices. User interfaces must be consistent, elegant and fun to use. Interacting with museum subject matter must be easy. The narratives must be valuable, engaging, shareable and worth sharing.

SJMA's digital team strives for a balance between developing internally-supported platforms (websites, blogs, mobile applications, etc.) and managing activity on third-party platforms (social media, email marketing, etc.). Activity on third-party platforms are platform-specific and make use of each platform's unique functionality.

We emphasize community and work to grow the depth of interactions around SJMA's artworks, artists, and the San José community through the lens of emerging technologies and digital culture.

### 2.3 Experience Integration

Onsite and online experiences should join up all aspects of the visitor experience before, during, and after a visit to the museum. This facilitates a stronger connection with the visitor and encourages them to return.
